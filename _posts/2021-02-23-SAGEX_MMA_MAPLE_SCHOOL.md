# Description

Recordings of scientific lectures relevant to the area of quantum scattering amplitudes within theoretical physics, using Mathematica and Maple. These lectures were part of the SAGEX Mathematica and Maple School (hosted by CEA-Saclay, Paris), which was held online from 4-13 January 2021.

These lectures are directed at graduate students and junior postdocs in theoretical particle physics and mathematical physics with a background and interest in scattering amplitudes.
