# Abstract:
We present analytic results for one of two types of planar QED two-loop integrals for $\mu e$ scattering including finite lepton masses. No approximations are made, such that the results are valid not only in the limit of a small electron mass. The results are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms with algebraic function arguments in a representation which allows for fast numerical evaluation in the physical phase-space.
