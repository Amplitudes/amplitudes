# Abstract:
We present the fully integrated form of the two-loop four-gluon amplitude in N=2 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics with gauge group SU(Nc) and with Nf massless supersymmetric quarks (hypermultiplets) in the fundamental representation. Our result maintains full dependence on Nc and Nf, and relies on the existence of a compact integrand representation that exhibits the duality between color and kinematics. Specializing to the N=2 superconformal theory, where Nf=2Nc , we obtain remarkably simple amplitudes that have an analytic structure close to that of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, except that now certain lower-weight terms appear. We comment on the corresponding results for other gauge groups.
