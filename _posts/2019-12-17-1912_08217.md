# Abstract:
We address the appearance of algebraic singularities in the symbol alphabet of scattering amplitudes in the context of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We argue that connections between cluster algebras and tropical geometry provide a natural language for postulating a finite alphabet for scattering amplitudes beyond six and seven points where the corresponding Grassmannian cluster algebras are finite. As well as generating natural finite sets of letters, the tropical fans we discuss provide letters containing square roots. Remarkably, the minimal fan we consider provides all the square root letters recently discovered in an explicit two-loop eight-point NMHV calculation.
