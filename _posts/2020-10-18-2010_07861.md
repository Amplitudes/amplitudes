# Abstract:
Electric-magnetic duality, the Newman-Janis shift, and the double copy all act by elementary operations on three-point amplitudes. At the same time, they generate a network of interesting classical solutions spanning from the Coulomb charge via the dyon to the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime. We identify the amplitudes corresponding to each of these solutions, working to all orders in spin, but to leading perturbative order. We confirm that the amplitudes double-copy when the solutions are related by the classical double copy. Along the way we show that the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution corresponds to a gravitational electric-magnetic duality rotation acting on the Kerr solution, again to all orders in spin, and demonstrate that the asymptotic charges also transform simply under our operations.
