# Abstract:
We compute the symbol of the full-color two-loop five-particle amplitude in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, including all non-planar subleading-color terms. The amplitude is written in terms of permutations of Parke-Taylor tree-level amplitudes and pure functions to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter, in agreement with previous conjectures. The answer has the correct collinear limits and infrared factorization properties, allowing us to define a finite remainder function. We study the multi-Regge limit of the non-planar terms, analyze its subleading power corrections, and present analytically the leading logarithmic terms.
