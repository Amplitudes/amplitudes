# Abstract:
The naive double-copy of (multi) loop amplitudes involving massive matter coupled to gauge theories will generically produce amplitudes in a gravitational theory that contains additional contributions from propagating antisymmetric tensor and dilaton states even at tree-level. We present a graph-based approach that combines the method of maximal cuts with double-copy construction to offer a systematic framework to isolate the pure Einstein-Hilbert gravitational contributions through loop level. Indeed this allows for a bootstrap of pure-gravitational results from the double-copy of massive scalar-QCD. We apply this to construct the novel result of the D-dimensional one-loop five-point QFT integrand relevant in the classical limit to generating observables associated with the radiative effects of massive black-hole scattering via pure Einstein-Hilbert gravity.
