# Abstract:
We describe a systematic framework for computing the conservative potential of a compact binary system using modern tools from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory. Our approach combines methods for integration and matching adapted from effective field theory, generalized unitarity, and the double-copy construction, which relates gravity integrands to simpler gauge-theory expressions. With these methods we derive the third post-Minkowskian correction to the conservative two-body Hamiltonian for spinless black holes. We describe in some detail various checks of our integration methods and the resulting Hamiltonian.
