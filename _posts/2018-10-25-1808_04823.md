# Abstract:
The pion-pole contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ is fully determined by the doubly-virtual pion transition form factor. Although this crucial input quantity is, in principle, directly accessible in experiment, a complete measurement covering all kinematic regions relevant for $(g-2)_\mu$ is not realistic in the foreseeable future. Here, we report in detail on a reconstruction from available data, both space- and time-like, using a dispersive representation that accounts for all the low-lying singularities, reproduces the correct high- and low-energy limits, and proves convenient for the evaluation of the $(g-2)_\mu$ loop integral. We concentrate on the systematics of the fit to $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data, which are key in constraining the isoscalar dependence, as well as the matching to the asymptotic limits. In particular, we provide a detailed account of the pion transition form factor at low energies in the time- and space-like region, including the error estimates underlying our final result for the pion-pole contribution, $a_\mu^{\pi^0\text{-pole}}=62.6^{+3.0}_{-2.5}\times 10^{-11}$, and demonstrate how forthcoming singly-virtual measurements will further reduce its uncertainty.
