# Job Description:
Job description:
The Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITP-CAS), and Cornell University have an opening for a joint postdoctoral associate position. We are searching for a candidate in the area of High-Energy Particle Physics, especially related to the Collective behavior of Symmetry Breaking, Effective Field Theory, Quantum Field Theory, Scattering Amplitudes and Gravitational Wave Physics.

The ITP-CAS is the largest and the top institute of theoretical physics in China (like IAS in the USA) and Cornell University is a top university in the United States.

Both Chinese and non-Chinese can also apply for Fellowships of Young International Scientists in CAS, which includes other benefits like extra salary and extra fundings.

The position is guaranteed for at least two years (with a very high possibility to extend to three years). Read more about this and how to apply on the INSPIRES posting.
