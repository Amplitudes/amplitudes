# Abstract:
Recently, a recursion relation has been developed, generating the four-dimensional integrand of the amplitudes of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for any number of loops and legs. In this paper, I provide a comparison of the prediction for the two-loop six-point maximally helicity-violating (MHV) integrand against the result obtained by use of the leading singularity method. The comparison is performed numerically for a large number of randomly selected momenta and in all cases finds agreement between the two results to high numerical accuracy.
