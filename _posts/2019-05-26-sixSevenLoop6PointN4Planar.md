# Abstract:
We compute the six-particle maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) and next-to-MHV (NMHV) amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory through seven loops and six loops, respectively, as an application of the extended Steinmann relations and using the cosmic Galois coaction principle. Starting from a minimal space of functions constructed using these principles, we identify the amplitude by matching its symmetries and predicted behavior in various kinematic limits. Through five loops, the MHV and NMHV amplitudes are uniquely determined using only the multi-Regge and leading collinear limits. Beyond five loops, the MHV amplitude requires additional data from the kinematic expansion around the collinear limit, which we obtain from the Pentagon Operator Product Expansion, and in particular from its single-gluon bound state contribution. We study the MHV amplitude in the self-crossing limit, where its singular terms agree with previous predictions. Analyzing and plotting the amplitudes along various kinematical lines, we continue to find remarkable stability between loop orders.
