# Abstract:
We investigate the renormalization structure of scalar Galileons in flat spacetime. We explicitly calculate the ultraviolet divergent one-loop contributions to the 2-point, 3-point, 4-point, and 5-point functions. We discuss the structure of the counterterms and their hierarchy within an effective field theory expansion. We comment on different resummation schemes, including a geometric resummation for which our results could be generalized to arbitrary n-point functions.
