# Abstract:
We present bipartiteSUSY, a Mathematica package designed to perform calculations for physical theories based on bipartite graphs. In particular, the package can employ the recently developed arsenal of techniques surrounding on-shell diagrams in N=4 SYM scattering amplitudes, including those for non-planar diagrams, with particular attention to computational speed. It also contains a host of tools for computations in N=1 Bipartite Field Theories, which utilize the same bipartite graphs. Through the use of an interactive graphical tool, it is possible to draw the desired diagrams on the screen and compute commonly sought-after features. The package should be easily accessible to users with little or no previous experience in dealing with bipartite graphs and their combinatorial descriptions.
