# Abstract:
We reproduce the two-loop seven-point remainder function in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by direct integration of conformally-regulated chiral integrands. The remainder function is obtained as part of the two-loop logarithm of the MHV amplitude, the regularized form of which we compute directly in this scheme. We compare the scheme-dependent anomalous dimensions and related quantities in the conformal regulator with those found for the Higgs regulator.
