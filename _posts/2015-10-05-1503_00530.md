# Abstract:
We investigate the construction of tree-level MHV gluon amplitudes in multiplet bases using BCFW recursion. The multiplet basis decomposition can either be obtained by decomposing results derived in (for example) the DDM basis or by formulating the recursion directly in the multiplet basis. We focus on the latter approach and show how to efficiently deal with the color structure appearing in the recursion. For illustration, we also explicitly calculate the four-, five- and six-gluon amplitudes.
