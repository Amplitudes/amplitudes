# Abstract:
In this paper, we propose an improved method for directly calculating double-copy-compatible tree numerators in (super-)Yang-Mills and Yang-Mills-scalar theories. Our new scheme gets rid of any explicit dependence on reference orderings, restoring a form of crossing symmetry to the numerators. This in turn improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm, allowing us to go well beyond the number of external particles accessible with the reference order based methods. Motivated by a parallel study of one-loop BCJ numerators from forward limits, we explore the generalization to include a pair of fermions. To improve the accessiblity of the new algorithm, we provide a Mathematica package that implements the numerator construction. The structure of the computation also provides for a straightforward introduction of minimally-coupled massive particles potentially useful for future computations in both classical and quantum gravity.
