# Abstract:
The most general class of 4D N=4 conformal supergravity actions depends on a holomorphic function of the scalar fields that parametrize an SU(1,1)/U(1) coset space. The bosonic sector of these actions was presented in a letter [arXiv:1609.09083]. Here we provide the complete actions to all orders in the fermion fields. They rely upon a new N=4 density formula, which permits a direct but involved construction. This density formula also recovers the on-shell action for vector multiplets coupled to conformal supergravity. Applications of these results in the context of Poincar\'e supergravity are briefly discussed.
