All [2018 Amplitudes summer school lectures](http://qmap.ucdavis.edu/events/events-past-events/amplitudes-summer-school),
hosted by Mathematics and Physics (QMAP).

# Lecturers
Nima Arkani-Hamed, Zvi Bern, Jacob Bourjaily, Claude Duhr, Eric D\'Hoker, Song He, Yutin Huang, Alexander Postnikov.

# Description
 Scattering amplitudes are the arena where quantum field theory directly confronts experiment, and the precise predictions are crucial for the beyond Standard Model searches at particle colliders such as LHC. At the same time, scattering amplitudes have revealed beautiful and intriguing mathematical structures and patterns which suggest that our fundamental understanding of quantum field theory is far from complete. The study of scattering amplitudes has been a very active area of research over the past few years, with applications ranging from precision calculations for the LHC through new approaches to gauge theories and gravity and ending with exciting connections to pure mathematics.
