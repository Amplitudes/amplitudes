# How to build a theory group site?

I've taken a lot of inspiration from many people.

Very specifically, initial content and organization strongly influenced by:
* Round 0: [Leo Stein's Personal Page](http://duetosymmetry.com)
    * I learned
        * How easy it is to serve personal static sites off of GitHub. Source for the DTP Group site is  [here](https://github.com/dtp-group/dtp-group/tree/gh-pages).
        * The [minimal mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) is pretty convenient and configurable.
* Round 1: [C. Titus Brown's DIB Lab page](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/). Especially:
    * [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct/) -- everyone should feel safe to get things done.
    * [Work Guidelines](/workguidelines/) -- coordinating expectations are great. A little iffy on the idea of mandatory weekly summaries, but I'm going to give it a shot. Future PI's definitely need to get used to reporting on how their spending their time. My last 3 years of Stanford I was co-leader on a grant with Renata Kallosh and had periodic quarterly reports. I found that this was greatly helped when it occurred to me to regularly jot down what I'd gotten done. As I start being *really* responsible for jr folks' careers I'm more sensitive to the balance of keeping up with how they're doing without breathing down their necks. Definitely realizing that a lot of meeting time can be spent on status updates instead of brain-storming.
    * [Welcome to New Members](/newResources/)Having new members "pull" requests to update the group page. At least I'll know that new folks can a) fork a repository b) submit a pull request.
    * Clear open-science advocacy in [Philosophy/Mission](/whatwedo/).  Specifically general advocacy for data-focused open science -- for theoretical physics this is generically much more of a default. We *want* people to use our calculations, data, theories, and techniques. Anything that makes this easier is a win. Awesome to engage with some of the spectacular platforms/strategies/approaches that bio/astro/experimentalists are mainstreaming.
* Round 2: [Ethan White's Lab page](http://ethanwhite.org). Especially:
    * [Open grants/funding page](/funding/) with links to submitted docs and source.
