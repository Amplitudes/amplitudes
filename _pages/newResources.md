Welcome!  This is for new group members / visitors.

## Group Things
1. First make sure your "more information" link is correct and formatted as you like it on the [members](/members/) page. If not, update it with a (pull request)[https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/].
2. Please add at least one thing to *this* page with a pull request -- something that you wish you would have seen written down somewhere.

Make sure to ask JJMC to update the web site after any pull requests.
