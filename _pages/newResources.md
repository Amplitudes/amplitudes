Welcome!  This is for new group members / visitors.

## Group Things
1. First make sure your "more information" link is correct and formatted as you like it on the [members](/members/) page. If not, update it with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
2. Please add at least one thing to *this* page with a pull request -- something that you wish you would have seen written down somewhere.

Make sure to ask JJMC to update the web site after any pull requests.

## Platforms/Tech geared towards / facilitating open science...

0. [ORCID](orcid.org)  online record id.  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/help/orcid) will be using orcid id preferentially as time goes on so good to link up.  

1. [Open Science Framework](osf.io)  --- can setup workflows for projects, associated wiki's for collaboration, create dois/arks. Possible data management strategies.  Can sign in with orcid. To my knowledge no custom urls.

2. Data repositories[^dataCite]
      * [Dataverse](http://thedata.org): "A repository for research data that takes care of long-term preservation and good archival practices, while   researchers can share, keep control of, and get recognition for their data."
      * [FigShare](http://figshare.com): "A repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, shareable, and discoverable manner."
      * [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org): "A repository service that enables researchers, scientists, projects, and institutions to share and showcase multidisciplinary research results (data and publications) that are not part of existing institutional or subject-based repositories."  CERN related.
      * [Dryad](http://datadryad.org): "A repository that aims to make data archiving as simple and as rewarding as possible through a suite of services not necessarily provided by publishers or institutional websites."
      * [DataBib](http://databib.org): "Databib is a tool for helping people identify and locate online repositories of research data. Users and bibliographers create and curate records that describe data repositories that users can search."
      * [Re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org): "Re3data is a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines for researchers, funding bodies, publishers, and scholarly institutions."
      * [Open Access Directory](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories): "A list of repositories and databases for open data."
      * [Force 11 Catalog](http://www.force11.org/catalog): "A dynamic inventory of web-based scholarly resources, a collection of alternative publication systems, databases, organizations and groups, software, services, standards, formats, and training tools."

3. Code repositories
   * [github](http://github.com):  hosting service using [git](http://git-scm.com)  (supports project oriented static websites)
   * [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org): hosting service using  [git](http://git-scm.com) or [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com).
   * [gitlab](http://gitlab.com):  hosting service using [git](http://git-scm.com)
        * [gitlab vs github](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Gitlab-compare-to-Github)
4. "Citable" code (??)
    * [zenodo](http://zenodo.org) Links to github, [instructions](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
