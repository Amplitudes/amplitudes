### Computers are great. Ideas are better.

The DTP Group proudly pursues the strategy of  pushing the line of *failure-point predictions*.  These require calculations that take modern methods and world-class technologies to their breaking-point.  To make progress, by definition, this invites new ideas, new physical stories, and ultimately the apprehension of novel structure. The goal is deep physical insight, with a joy in developing and leveraging --- for mutual benefit --- domain expertise in scattering amplitudes, relativity, quantum field theory, string theory, and cosmology.

Like players of [*advanced chess*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Chess), group members happily invoke algorithms and automation to explore and prune the diverging tree of candidate moves in our exploration.  


  The group is located on the [Saclay plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay), in the [Institute for Theoretical Physics (IPhT)](http://ipht.cea.fr/en/), [CEA-Saclay](http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en) and [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

  The group is run by Dr. John Joseph M. Carrasco, Permanent Member of IPhT; you can see many of the group's publications [here](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=author%3AJ.J.M.Carrasco.1). You can read more about the group members under [Group members](/members).
