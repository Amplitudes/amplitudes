## Computers are great. Ideas are better.

The DTP Group likes to push the line of *failure-point predictions*.  These involve calculations that take modern methods and world-class technologies to their breaking-point.  To make progress, by definition, this strategy invites new ideas, new physical stories, and ultimately the apprehension of novel structure.

The goal is deep physical insight, with a joy in developing and leveraging --- for mutual benefit --- domain expertise in scattering amplitudes, relativity, quantum field theory, string theory, and cosmology.

Like players of [*advanced chess*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Chess), group members are encouraged to invoke algorithms and automation to aid in tactically navigating the diverging tree of candidate moves.

  The group is located on the [Saclay plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay), in the [Institute for Theoretical Physics (IPhT)](http://ipht.cea.fr/en/), [CEA-Saclay](http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en) and [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

  The group is run by [Dr. John Joseph M. Carrasco](http://prettyquestions.com), Permanent Member of IPhT. You can find most of the group's publications [here](/publications/). You can learn more about individual group members [here](/members/).
