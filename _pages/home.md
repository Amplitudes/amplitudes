## Invariance is as invariance does.

This is an experiment in an open-community resource-linking. As currently conceived it's aiming to connect amplitude results ([integrated](/integrals/) and [integrand](/integrands/)),  [software](/software/), and [lecture materials](/lectures/) relevant to the scattering amplitudes community.
