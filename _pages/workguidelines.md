We work at the pleasure of money granted from either private institutions or through the trust of the public.  In either case we have an obligation to see this money is  well-spent.  I don't think this means a lot of bureaucracy, but I do think it means a periodic and active reflection on:
 * what our responsibilities are
 * how efficient we are in communicating with each other.
 * how efficient we are in communicating with our greater scientific community and the interested public

I tend to think of these types of guidelines as coordinating documents; not legalistic as much as aspirational and communicative.

 I looked around to see if I could find some examples, and surprisingly enough, not only wasn't there a lot to be found for theoretical physics. It was as if the only guideline that mattered was the one already ingrained in all of us: *do awesome work*.

That's fine.  But there's more to being functional than just doing awesome work.  The writeup I felt closest to my ideal starting point was Titus Brown's, located [here](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/work-guidelines.html), from which I did indeed lift shamelessly.    ( While exploring his site I also came across his "Lab Code of Conduct", which I think is an excellent idea, and one I've incorporated [here](/code_of_conduct/).)

# Responsibilities of group members

## All scientific group members
* Uphold [group's code of conduct](/code_of_conduct/)
* Take care of yourself[^care].
* Invest in research you *care* about.  If you aren't passionate about what you're looking at, you *should* be looking at something else.
* Support each other.
  *  We each come with different domains of expertise, and specialization in a  collaborative context can mean spectacular results. Surprising success in absolutely unexpected directions will come from leveraging mutual domain expertise.
* Build up the greater community
    * Cite well and inclusively.
      * References in theoretical physics aren't merely the breadcrumbs we find useful.  They exist to weave our contributions into the greater web of the academic program. Standard practice is to refer to any relevant work whether or not it was interesting / useful / pedagogical / a complete waste of your time.  If some work is problematic -- don't ignore it, politely point out what you found useful and what traps might be ahead for the unsuspecting reader.
    * Acknowledge help/ideas/inspiration/conversation *generously* -- it costs us nothing other than perhaps a moment spent to reflect on what helped us get where we are.
    * Take the time to put your work in context that the audience (seminar/colloquium/conference talk/lecture/public-talk/article) can understand and relate to.
    * Share data, code, aesthetics, and perspective openly and generously.
    * Referee responsibly.
      * If you commit to refereeing, do so.
      If you cannot spend the time to do a good job, or if it's outside an area you feel comfortable with the responsible thing to do is decline. If you do take on a


[^care]: Good science, like many things worth doing in life, is a marathon, not a sprint. But how you run this race effects your ability and willingness to go after another. You not only want to  make it to this finish line, but the next, and the next and the next...

## JJ's responsibilities as PI:

* Find funding, or give fair notice when funding is going to lapse.
* Make himself available for meetings as necessary.
* "Fly cover" for administrative, paperwork, and grant-reporting issues.
* Provide scientific leadership.
* Provide career guidance and help group members work towards *their* career goals
  * Promote visibility for current and former group members.
  * Provide growth opportunities for group members.
  * Write recommendation letters to support current and former members.
  * Provide realistic performance feedback as requested.
* Resolve disputes within the group.

## Graduate student responsibilities:

* Meet their graduate school reporting and exam requirements.
* Identify and develop research projects with the help of the PI.
* Apply effort to their research and work towards a PhD-worthy body of work.
* Attend and present at group meetings and journal clubs.
* Schedule necessary committee meetings.
* Submit weekly summary.

## Post-doc responsibilities:

* Identify and develop research projects with the help of the PI.
* Attend and present at group meetings and journal clubs.
* Define their career goals and work towards them.
* Pursue projects and collaborations that further their own career goals.
* Provide scientific and technical leadership within the group.
* Submit weekly summary.


## Weekly summaries

Everyone is expected to file brief weekly summaries covering what they've been
up to; this provides both JJ and the group member with context and
trajectory going forward, and means that in-person meetings can focus
on specific issues rather than be more general reporting.

Filing weekly summaries is part of being a group member.  Repeated failure
to file weekly reports may be taken to imply that you no longer wish
to be a member of the group.  Note  that it is **not** JJ's job to
remind you to submit weekly reports.

----

Weekly reports can and should be minimalist - basically, list

* what you've been working on, including progress made
  and obstacles overcome;
* deferred items and upcoming issues;
* long term goals;
* anything else you want JJ to know, including personal issues.

Most of the summary can  be copy-pasted from the previous week;
feel free to do so.  If it takes you more than 10 minutes to do each
week, you're probably overdoing it.

----

Weekly summaries should be filed *weekly*, and generally by the same
time each week, as long as you let JJ know when that is (e.g. by
Friday 5pm; or by Monday noon; or...)

If you are taking time off, then note that in advance and don't submit
weekly reports during that period.

If work-related travel is coming up, please submit a report BEFORE the
travel and AFTER the travel.

## Travel


* Get permission from JJ before booking any travel over €200.
  Under €200, "lazy consensus" can be applied, meaning email him and default is "yes"
  unless he raises an objection within 3 working days.  
  If the travel is more urgent, mention "urgent" in the email subject.

* Travel should be booked 15 days in advance in order to be reimbursable.

* To get reimbursed for trips, contact Sylvie with your reimbursement
  request and please CC JJ on the e-mail.

## Orders


The group money is to be used for support of our research goals; so,
JJ will tend to consider requests to buy research tangibles
(computers, books, etc.) favorably .  Please sketch out the need in a
sentence, price things out roughly, and identify alternatives (more and/or
  less expensive).

Under €1800,

* Under €200, use "lazy consensus". 3 working days notice, please.
Check following before ordering
    * Library for books/journals etc.
    * Laurent for software licenses etc.

* Orders under €1800 can be done without a ton of paperwork after clearing with JJ.


------------------------

Over €1800, JJ needs to be involved with the paperwork...
