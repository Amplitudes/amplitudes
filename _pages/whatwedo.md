## Scientific Mission Statement

The Declarative Theoretical Physics group pursues broad interests in fundamental physics. We build and leverage *theoretical data* towards discovering new frameworks for:

* scattering amplitudes;
* formal quantum field theory and string theory;
* precision cosmology;
* gravitational astrophysics.

You are welcome to perceive, if you like, a certain gravity-focused theme weaving its way through all of this.  Our passion is to understand the rules of the universe relevant to whatever scales we are considering.

As we confront ever more subtle questions, the future of physical discovery will progress all the more rapidly through profound engagement with computation and data analysis.  This is just as true, if not more so, for us analytic theorists as our experimental and  simulation-building colleagues. We see it as part of our mission to celebrate the creative use of code for exploration, construction, verification, and analysis.


## Developmental Mission Statement

We believe that ultimately the best way to reach our personal career goals, no matter what  stage, is to ardently pursue our scientific passions.  The specifics will of course depend on where we are career-wise and where we're trying to get to.  The developmental mission of the group is to provide our members with the opportunity and support to optimize their reach for what come next. This means offering to share our scientific domain experience in support of individual goals.  It means creating space for people to build and excel at the type of skills they will need for their next positions, and ensuring that members engage meaningfully with the greater community they aspire to be a part of.

## Group name

 The active part of our group name is shared by a programming paradigm that also prefers placing focus on the logic of what should be accomplished rather then be tied to details of particular implementations. We think this is a good way to do physics. For more information see [Naming a research group](http://prettyquestions.com/thoughts/Naming_a_research_group/).

## Open science

  We are fortunate enough to live in a time where the noise of relentless self-aggrandizement is absolutely drowned out by the signal of a huge community of scientists, programmers, and hobbyists actively engaged in pursuing fascinating problems.  We highly value collaboration and believe the scientific enterprise is best served by all of us sharing our ideas, approaches and results as *usefully* as possible:

* All papers are submitted to preprint servers.
* All *analytic* data, when sufficiently complicated, should be presented in a readily machine parsable form linked to from relevant publications.
* All code when released, should be released with source under *an* [open license](https://choosealicense.com).
