All members of the DTP group, along with visitors, and generally every functioning member of society, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as necessary. We expect active cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version
The group is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are universally unacceptable for any group venue, including group meetings, presentations, or discussions.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members or visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [JJ Carrasco](mailto:john-joseph.carrasco@ipht.fr) immediately.  For official concerns, please see the HR office of CEA.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any group-related event.

This code of conduct is based specifically on that of Titus Brown's [DIB Lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html).
