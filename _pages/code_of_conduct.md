All members of the DTP group, along with visitors, and sentient beings in general, are expected to act in concordance with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as necessary. We expect active cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and collaborative environment for everybody.

## The Quickest Version ('Techer-style)
[*No member of the community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the community.*](http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/content/honor-code).

## The Quick Version
Complementing its dedication to open collaboration, trust, and development, the group is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are universally unacceptable for any group venue, including group meetings, presentations, or discussions.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members or visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [JJ Carrasco](mailto:john-joseph.carrasco@ipht.fr) immediately. If for whatever reasons you would not feel comfortable coming to JJ,  [Juna Kollmeier](https://carnegiescience.edu/scientist/juna-kollmeier) (jak at carnegiescience.edu), has volunteered to be a safe informal point of contact;  she works for neither JJ nor IPhT, and has agreed to help mediate if ever necessary. For official concerns, group members must see the HR office of CEA.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any group-related event.

This code of conduct is based specifically on that of Titus Brown's [DIB Lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html).
